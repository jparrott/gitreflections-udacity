What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing a repository creates an empty repository. Before this is done, no changes are tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows the user to be selective in what they commit by creating a separate area inside the working directory. Items in the working directory are not tracked. This way, if you have several files with only a few that have actual changes you don't have to commit the entire project, only the ones that have changed.
