When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Remote repositories could be useful for group projects with multiple contributers. It could also act as a backup of sorts if your local machine were to go down for whatever reason.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Accidental deletion or insertion, or maybe a bug in the code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A branch is a diversion from the master line of commits contained within a repository. A fork is made only on GitHub and is a copy of a complete repository with a link back to the original source. A clone is a copy of a complete repository.
